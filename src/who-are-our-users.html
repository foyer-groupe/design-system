				<p>We mostly address to our Designers and Developers in a first step. But our target is larger than just "our", or just those profiles.</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				When you start building a product you have to define your users, all of them. When you develop the product you focus on a part of your users. The Foyer Design System respect this Agile approach that's why we mostly work for our Designers and Developers.
