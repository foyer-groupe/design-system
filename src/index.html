                            Foyer Design System (FDS) is built with the same principle than organism. Small molecules can create beautiful living beings.<br>
                            Each User Interface (UI) element can be used standalone or can be associated to other to build more complex component, called an organism.<br>
                            Each UI element is encapsulate in a NPM library to be easily imported in your project and to manage his dependencies.

                    We also test on iPhone and Android for all MobileApp components. <br>
                    You can find information about compatibility in each component documentation.

                            <b>When do we need to ask the FDS team to add the stuff we need ?</b><br>
                            <p>Well you don't. All the designers have the FDS components in their design tools, and thus when they create a new mock, they know already if something is missing.
                            They will tell the FDS team what is needed, and when the devs are supposed to have it (basically at the start of a <i>sprint</i>).
                            As making mistakes is human nature, if it ever happens that one feature is missing on a component, you should discuss it with the FDS team directly.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>How to use the components' Javascript ?</b>
                            <p>There is <b>NO JavaScript</b> shipped with the packages.
                            At the moment, components who rely <b>heavily</b> on <i>JS</i> aren't in the FDS (i.e. carousel, ...).
                            Sometimes, you can find a JS tab in the documentation (open/close modal, ...), it is mainly used to make the doc working, and should be redone completly inside your JS files.
                            We have been working with <i>MEO</i> to style some components they have been doing. You can find a list <a href="https://github.foyer.lu/pages/PoleUX/Foyer-Design-System/angular-components.html">here</a>.<br>
                            We also have started a web component library based on <a href="https://github.foyer.lu/pages/PoleUX/Foyer-Design-System/stenciljs-components.html">StencilJs</a>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>When should I use custom CSS ?</b><br>
                            <p>Basically, some details (i.e. position of an element inside a Panel, ...) may not be achievable directly with the FDS components.
                            You should always have a look first at the <a href="https://github.foyer.lu/pages/PoleUX/Foyer-Design-System/utilities.html">utilities</a> package which offers several classes acting as inline style.
                            <br>
                            If you have a specific request, you can see with the FDS team if they have some time to help out.
                            It happened that the team did some work which won't be reused through several projects. That work lies in the <a href="https://github.foyer.lu/pages/PoleUX/Foyer-Design-System/labs.html">Labs</a>.
                            When you do integrate what's in the <i>Labs</i>, you need to copy the source from the <a href="https://github.foyer.lu/PoleUX/Foyer-Design-System/tree/master/Labs">Github</a> and use it directly inside your project.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>How do I report bugs ?</b>
                            <p>If this is a critical issue, you should always come to see the team directly.
                            Otherwise, the best way is to create a case on <a href="https://github.foyer.lu/PoleUX/Foyer-Design-System/issues/new?template=bug_report.md">Github</a>.
                            </p>
