# Foyer Design System

This repository is here to centralized the content of our public Design System.

## What's inside

This Design System currently represents approximately 13.37% of the full suite used by our teams at Groupe Foyer.

We've chosen to release this portion of our work to the public to invite external feedback and to champion the principles of user-centric design. By sharing this, we hope to foster a collaborative dialogue that will help us refine and enhance our Design System over time. This is just the beginningâ€”more elements will be gradually added as we continue to develop and perfect our approach.
