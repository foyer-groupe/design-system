# Foyer Design System

This repository is here to centralized the content of our public Design System.

## What's inside

This Design System is about 13.37% (at the moment) of our complete Design System used by our teams.

We decided to publish a little piece of our work to get feedback from the outside and promote the user-centric design by Groupe Foyer.
It will be completed piece by piece.
