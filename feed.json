This blog is to share all of that with you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ec7kr6c92\">Evolution of a Design Team</h2>\n<p>We started small, I was a contractor working from Paris and sometimes at Foyer Head Quarters. I quickly got support from some people within the company who share the same vision has mine.</p>\n<p>Design is oftentime put on the side, in addition of some other \"constraints\" —like it's a constraint…— while it should be put right at the top of the first reflexions.</p>\n<p>The team got the opportunity to grow up quickly, 3 new team members in 2017, and now we are 10. Yes, 10, I'm so proud of that, and glad that Foyer have trust in our vision!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://www.design.foyer.lu/blog/media/posts/3/foyer-design-system-luxembourg-kaorianne.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1818\" height=\"1356\">\n<figcaption >From left to right: Matthieu, Bastien, Laurent, Steven B., Florentin, Jordan, Julie, Geoffrey, Steven L., Léa</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ec7m70p20\">Evolution of our Projects and Tools</h2>\n<p>As designers, we tend to find the right tools/solutions for the right needs. Some years ago developers would take all the design decisions by guessing user needs. No need to tell you that guessing is not the best way to get it done properly.</p>\n<p>Today, we use and maintain a <a href=\"https://www.design.foyer.lu/\">Design System</a> to build user interfaces, design decisions are made after long phases of user research, or at least a way better understanding of our user needs. Almost all the projects start with a scrum framework and at least a designer in the team: this was not even imaginable some days ago.</p>\n<p>The other big change is that we came from designing for one entity, Foyer Assurances, to 4 different Foyer entities: Wealins, CapitalatWork, Foyer Global Health, mostly for their internal tools and interfaces.</p>\n<p>To be able to handle all of that, our tools evolved: we abandoned Sketch and Zeplin to give a chance to Figma, and we don't regret it. <a href=\"https://www.design.foyer.lu/blog/design-system-great-tools.html\">Figma</a> allows a big scalability, the tool evolve in the good way, and the management of our design system is made much easier. And it's only an example among others.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ec7nb8tc1\">Blog Post to Expect</h2>\n<p>Frankly? We don't know yet. Geoffrey proposed 2 blog posts to kick start the blog, and I'm sure our Designers would be glad to share with you all kind of content: Illustration research, Accessibility, user research, usability, etc.</p>\n<p>Don't expect a steady pace from us, our team is quite busy, but we will put our best effort in it to bring new posts to you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ec7ocmj62\">Read our friends</h2>\n<p>We are not the only ones publishing, we've even been inspired by our friend from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maif, the french Designer's blog: <a href=\"https://design.maif.fr/blog/\">https://design.maif.fr/blog/</a></li>\n<li>Société Générale, Stories from UX Practitioners: <a href=\"https://medium.com/societe-generale-design\">https://medium.com/societe-generale-design</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Happy reading to you!</p>",

I did test other solutions like Adobe XD or Sketch, but the  cross-OS compatibility and the way it works matches my way of working on a Design System.</p>\n<p>The Team features are really useful for onboarding people in a team of designers.

It means that when you create your file to work on an interface using your Design System, you can deactivate the libraries you don’t need. I don’t know why you would need to do that, but you can do it 😀<br> Our existing System is quite big, but I never notices any lag using it or searching through the big amount of Master Components.</p>\n<p>There is also <strong>Live Collaboration</strong> where you can work on the exact same object in the exact same file.

Everything is included  into Figma: version control, blame tool, files saved in the cloud. And yes, you can <a href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040328553-Work-offline-with-Figma\">work offline</a> as soon as you already loaded your work, the tool will save locally your work and push it online when your connection is retablished.<br> For Organizations, if you need to have an enhanced security, <a href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040532333-Getting-Started-with-SAML-SSO\">Figma allows SAML SSO</a>.</p>\n<p>Figma is also all about the community around it: <strong>Plugins</strong> and <strong>Shared files</strong> made by the community for free are available and can easily be activated for all your team members. The onboarding for building a plugin is so simple that I’ve made one to prepare your <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/771341909571444129/PWA-Icon-App-Exports\">exports for PWA Icons</a>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7215\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><picture class=\"size-full wp-image-7215\"> </picture></figure>\n<img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://www.design.foyer.lu/blog/media/posts/2/design-system-tool-figma-community2x.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1231px) 100vw, 1231px\" srcset=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/design-system-tool-figma-community@2x.jpg 1231w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/design-system-tool-figma-community@2x-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/design-system-tool-figma-community@2x-600x347.jpg 600w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/design-system-tool-figma-community@2x-768x444.jpg 768w\" width=\"1231\" height=\"712\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_7215\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><picture class=\"size-full wp-image-7215\"> </picture>\n<figcaption>The Community page within Figma</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Figma is free for up to 2 editors and 3 projects, which is really enough for students or small design teams.

The advantage of this tool is that <strong>you can synchronize your design file</strong> to keep the documentation up to date. It <strong>works like a charm with Figma</strong> which offers a powerful API.</p>\n<video width=\"300\" height=\"150\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" preload=\"metadata\" src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/designers.mp4?_=1\" ></video>\n<p>When I built the <a href=\"https://design.foyer.lu/\">Foyer Design System</a> website, I did it with simple HTML files, it took me a bit of time just for the template and the responsive aspect of the website. The structure was based on the existing internal Design System we have at Foyer for our complete documentation. (yeah the public website is not even 5% of the complete documentation)</p>\n<p>When I started to work on the <a href=\"https://www.capitalatwork.com/en/\">CapitalatWork</a> Design System for our internal needs (in-house applications) I needed something efficient with a fast setup. Zeroheight allowed me to build several pages of documentation in a morning.</p>\n<video width=\"300\" height=\"150\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" preload=\"metadata\" src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/developers.mp4?_=2\" ></video>\n<p>The tool allows you to <strong>build visual documentation</strong> as well as <strong>technical documentation</strong>. It synchronizes your design file ; in my case Figma with the imported Frames, Components or Styles I decided to import and document. There is some pre-made blocks of contents that can easily cover 90% of your needs for a great Design System structure and content.</p>\n<p>When designers or developers will join me on completing the documentation, we’ll be able to write it collaboratively at the same time.</p>\n<video width=\"300\" height=\"150\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" preload=\"metadata\" src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/editors.mp4?_=3\" ></video>\n<p>Zeroheight is free for one editor, enough to get started, and starts at $15/month/editor. It’s also :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design Tokens up-to-date</li>\n<li>Synchronized files and Design Assets</li>\n<li>Inspection of the details of your components</li>\n<li>Version History (Company offer)</li>\n<li>Custom Domain Name (Company offer)</li>\n<li>Private System protected by a password (Company offer)</li>\n<li>SAML SSO + User Permissions (Enterprise offer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"center\"><a class=\"demo\" href=\"https://zeroheight.com/\">Learn more about ZeroHeight</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"code\">UI Kit and Code Tools</h2>\n<p>Here are some of the dev-oriented tools I found or use(d) with my team on our Design Systems. Again it’s not easy to separate design and dev on this topic, but those tools will talk way more to developers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ec2vbq682\">StencilJS – Reusable Components</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://stenciljs.com\">StencilJS</a> is a powerful tool to build reusable components compatible with a lot of frameworks. It’s ideal when you work in an environment where React and Angular are part of your projects, and not only those. It’s a cross-framework tool.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stencil is a toolchain for building reusable, scalable Design Systems. Generate small, blazing fast, and 100% standards based Web Components that run in every browser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>StencilJS has JSX support and is built in a way that it’s future-proof: native Web Components with polyfill, that brings support for all types of environment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://www.design.foyer.lu/blog/media/posts/2/design-system-tool-stenciljs2x.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px\" srcset=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/design-system-tool-stenciljs@2x.png 1436w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/design-system-tool-stenciljs@2x-300x141.png 300w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/design-system-tool-stenciljs@2x-600x282.png 600w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/design-system-tool-stenciljs@2x-768x360.png 768w\" width=\"1436\" height=\"674\">\n<p> </p>\n<p>It also brings simplicity into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual comparison: UI diff with screenshot,</li>\n<li>Documentation: with auto-generated component doc and CSS variables,</li>\n<li>Dev environment: Built-in dev-server for hot module reloading.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We decided at the start of building our Design System that we shall never write JavaScript as long as we are surrounded by different environment (PHP, WordPress, and Angular). “We are writing only HTML and CSS”.<br> While building our in-house Design System, a need emerged: unify interaction within some more complex components, to keep user experience consistency. A teammate within our Design System Core Team decided to give a try to StencilJS, and it worked quite well.</p>\n<p class=\"center\"><a class=\"demo\" href=\"https://stenciljs.com\">Learn more about StencilJS</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ec2vbq684\">HTML &amp; CSS Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Yeah I know, it’s kind of weird to consider HTML and CSS as tools, but they really are. You won’t be able to build accessible and strong patterns without those knowledge.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I see more and more “Front-End Developers” being only JS Framework users (yeah users), like children playing with pieces of LEGO they don’t even understand the true nature. To build a Design System, you need someone working on raw HTML, with a strong understanding of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques\">Role-ARIA</a> and able to test the components on a lot of browsers and assistive technologies.<br> You need someone able to improvise custom CSS lines of code to adjust components and build variations of those, <a href=\"https://www.ishadeed.com/article/same-html-different-css/\">keeping the same HTML</a> (article by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shadeed9\">@shadeed9</a>) to avoid re-work on the implementation side.</p>\n<p>You need someone whose expertise is HTML and CSS only because being able to handle all kind of complex layout situation <strong>is a full time job</strong>, sometimes way more difficult than playing with pieces of LEGO.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn a bit more on Inclusive Components, I advise you this great reading: <a href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/\">Incluse Components</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heydonworks\">Heydon Pickering</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ec2vbq687\">Building a Design System is about humans…</h2>\n<p>Don’t forget that building a Design System is not about gathering the right tools but gathering the right persons around the table, communication and needs understanding.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7243\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><picture class=\"size-full wp-image-7243\"> </picture></figure>\n<img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://www.design.foyer.lu/blog/media/posts/2/foyer-design-system-luxembourg-kaorianne.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1818px) 100vw, 1818px\" srcset=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/foyer-design-system-luxembourg-kaorianne.jpg 1818w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/foyer-design-system-luxembourg-kaorianne-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/foyer-design-system-luxembourg-kaorianne-600x448.jpg 600w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/foyer-design-system-luxembourg-kaorianne-768x573.jpg 768w, https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/foyer-design-system-luxembourg-kaorianne-1536x1146.jpg 1536w\" width=\"1818\" height=\"1356\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_7243\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><picture class=\"size-full wp-image-7243\"> </picture>\n<figcaption>From left to right: Matthieu, Bastien, Laurent, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKcVce0geZzwSYuML0jj3g?view_as=subscriber\">Steven B.</a>, Florentin, Jordan, Julie, Geoffrey, Steven L., Léa — Photographer: <a href=\"http://www.kaorianne.com/\">Kaorianne</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The tools are here to help you build a strong relationship between at least developers and designers. They are supposed to help them speak the same language, filling the gap between those two fields, and serve a common goal: bring a consistency within interfaces for a better user experience.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right tool is not always easy, you will have to listen to each other to understand designers and developers needs. To improve you Design System, you have to do exactly the same thing as other products: listen to users, collect their needs and pain points, and build solutions.</p>\n<p>That’s the other 80% part. 😊</p>",

We looked at creating a card game fast enough to help our managers work with us on this exercise.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/user-task-card-prototype@2x.jpg\" alt=\"The first prototype we tested on a colleague\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption>The first prototype we tested on a colleague</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We had one day to conceptualize them, pre-test them, make them, print them, cut them out and test them the next day.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/user-task-first-print@2x.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption>The prototype tested on the left, the first set printed on the right</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"cards\">Context of use of our <span lang=\"en\">User Task Cards</span></h2>\n<p>To help our managers, we organized a small workshop with two of our end users, blocked 1 hour for the exercise. In hindsight, the time was not enough and we overran by 15 minutes, where it would have taken 1h30 instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ec27a6o91\">Introduce the concept</h3>\n<p>When you do something unusual with your users, it is important to introduce the context.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remind the context of the workshop (collecting their work habits)</li>\n<li>Announce that you will use cards to help them.</li>\n<li>Introduce the cards : <span lang=\"en\">Task</span>, <span lang=\"en\">Actions</span>/<span lang=\"en\">Decisions</span>, <span lang=\"en\">Objects</span>/<span lang=\"en\">Tools</span>, <span lang=\"en\">Interactions</span>/<span lang=\"en\">Dependencies</span>. We voluntarily did not introduce the <span lang=\"en\">Pain Points</span>, <span lang=\"en\">Magic Changes</span> and Meta-cards right away (they’re not all here in the previous images, by the way.) .</li>\n<li>Then present an example that is quite simple to understand from everyday life. We used the example of “Taking a shower” which generally speaks to all our users.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you run your example you need to remind yourself what each card implies and propose an order to present these cards. Order that will not necessarily be respected by your users and that’s totally fine.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span lang=\"en\"><strong>Task</strong></span> : this is the task you need to perform. You normally filled in this card with a “I need to take a shower”.</li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"en\">Actions</span>/</strong><span lang=\"en\"><strong>Decisions</strong></span> : it is about defining what you do to accomplish this task, and the decisions you need to make to accomplish the task. “I turn on the water”, “I wait for the hot water”, “I adjust the type of jet”, are possible options.</li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"en\">Tools</span>/</strong><span lang=\"en\"><strong>Objects</strong></span> : it is about specifying the tools and objects that you use to accomplish the task. “A washcloth”, “soap”, “a sponge” or “a towel” can be useful objects.</li>\n<li><strong><span lang=\"en\">Interactions</span>/</strong><span lang=\"en\"><strong>Dependencies</strong></span> : it is about providing more context to your task by reminding yourself of the people or other activities on which you depend. “The boilers”, “The cleanliness of the towel”, “The good maintenance of the siphon” can be dependencies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our initial mistake was to think that our users could fill out the cards <span lang=\"en\">Pain Points</span> and <span lang=\"en\">Magic Changes</span> later. In fact, they needed to express what bothers them early on. Give them this card early on by presenting it at the beginning, preserve the card <span lang=\"en\">Magic Changes</span> for later.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><span lang=\"en\"><strong>Pain Points</strong></span> : it represents the blocking or irritating points during the performance of the task. Usually it fills almost all by itself when you talk about tools, objects, interactions and dependencies. “Shower slips”, “Water is cold”, “Moisture rises quickly” can be pain points.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"cards-workshop\">Conduct of the workshop</h3>\n<p>Once the presentations were made, we suggested that managers complete a few task cards to list them.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/user-task-listing-activities@2x-1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption>Users filling in task cards</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>However, as they filled them out, they remembered the dependencies and tools they use. We ended up giving them free access to all the cards so that they could express themselves freely. They quickly took the tool in hand. We started making them work together.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/user-task-activities-columns@2x-1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption>Columns of tasks and their context</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In order to help them, we completed, while listening to them, the meta-cards, which offer more context to a given task. We only had the “Rhythm” card at that time, but we quickly realized the need for the “Where” and the duration.</p>\n<p>After a while, and because sometimes someone may take the lead in the group, we ended up separating the two managers to get more tasks and allow everyone to use their own memory.</p>\n<p>At the end of the workshop, we offered the “Magic Changes” card so that the user could imagine their own solution for the Pain Points encountered. At that time we took the example of the shower to present the concept to them. “Having a small auxiliary water-heater”, “Porous shower floor” or “motorized ventilation” can be solutions to the pain points in our shower story.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/user-task-activities-prioritized@2x-1.jpg.webp\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption>Many more tasks organized by columns</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Once it’s done, group your columns into small stacks for quick access to task information. We used small <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PGyR4U\" hreflang=\"fr\">wooden clamps</a> that are much more practical than paper clips here.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img src=\"https://www.creativejuiz.fr/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/user-task-activities-grouped@2x-1.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption>Stacks of our users’ tasks</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We obviously had not anticipated everything for this workshop, so here are some additional tips.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ec27ehgg2\">Some tips for this workshop</h3>\n<p>These tips are quite generic. Depending on your users and the context of your work, you will certainly need to adapt the exercise a little. A few things we have seen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plan at least 1h30 with two users working with you,</li>\n<li>Be at least 2 designers, it’s easier to support users and not forget anything. Especially if you want to take notes during the session,</li>\n<li>Present all cards from the beginning, including Pain Points, but except the Magic Changes card, which should be kept for the end.</li>\n<li>Arrange tasks by column or row to facilitate the completion of each task.</li>\n<li>You can help to fill in the context cards: “duration”, “where”, “rhythm” without any risk while listening to your users.</li>\n<li>Your users will probably highjack the game and do what they want with it. Unless you lose too much material because of this hacking, let them do it and be flexible. The important thing is to make it more fun for them and to create an automatism while not forgetting anything.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1ec27ehgg3\">Experience feedback</h3>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.foyer.lu/en\">Foyer</a>, we work in an Agile context. We develop features piece by piece, and we test them at each iteration with our end users. Each development comes from a need that we discovered thanks to this workshop and a proper <a href=\"https://www.productplan.com/glossary/story-mapping/\">story mapping</a>.</p>\n<p>After a few months of development and several weeks of use, the feedback is more than positive and the adoption of the tool is unequivocal: excellent. One of the many verbatim comments from our users that has brought me the most as a researcher is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s surprising, you’ve managed to understand our business without knowing anything about it at first.<br> — a user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"cards-dl\">Download the User Task Cards for free</h3>\n<p>You will find the latest version of the cards available for free here.
