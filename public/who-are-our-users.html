			<div class="intro-block">
				<p>We started with a real need: optimize working time to limit redundancy and loss of information through several projects.</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				There can be many reasons why your company starts working on a Design System. At Foyer the main reasons was <strong>avoiding redundancy</strong> in term of user research, user interface and code (front-end). Here a bit of context.

			<h2 class="h2-like" id="what">What is Foyer Design System?</h2>

			<p>
				Foyer Design System, also called FDS within the Company, is a System defined like our single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.
			</p>

			<p>
				It's considered like a product: it has its own lifecycles, backlog, issues, governance and users.
			</p>

			<h3 id="inside" class="h3-like">What is inside?</h3>

			<p>A Design System can cover a lot of subjects and deliverables. At Foyer, it covers deliverables and librairies for both developers and designers.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Developers</dt>
				<dd>They benefit from a library maintain by themself and our Design Team. Code quality is reviewed by our core team and delivered into the library as a package. The packages we build are techno-agnostic, that means that it is interoperable among various systems and not dependant on a particular language or library like Angular or React.</dd>

				<dt>Designers</dt>
				<dd>The benefit from a library maintain by themself and our Design Team. Components are designed and built when the need comes and after a precise definition of the goals. The library is currently maintained on Figma, and documented within this tool. The documentation will be migrate outside the tool to be independant and more sharable with our partners.</dd>
			</dl>

			<h2 class="h2-like" id="why">Why a Design System?</h2>

			<h3 class="h3-like" id="diversity">Diversity of our Projects</h3>
			
			<p>
				Foyer portals, websites and applications' ecosystem is complex. We develop and maintain several applications and portals <strong>at the same time</strong>, constaintly, while having limited transversal communication.
			</p>

			<p class="margin-big text-center">

			</p>

			<p>
				The Design System helps focusing on the specificity of each project by <strong>gathering the common needs</strong> in term of code en User Interface at the same place. It brings a new layer of communication between the Product Owner et Scrum teams.
			</p>

			
			<h3 class="h3-like" id="time">The Effect of Time</h3>
			
			<p>
				Projects are created when a need appears. Many projects are created at <strong>different moments</strong> in the life of Foyer and at different moments of the maturity timeline. Digital Transformation takes time in an almost 100 years old company.
			</p>

			<p class="margin-big text-center">
				<img src="img/schema-timeline.png" srcset="img/schema-timeline@2x.png 2x" width="540" height="195" alt="Project starting at different times">
			</p>

			<p>
				The Design System helps by <strong>inventoring and challenging</strong> the existing pieces of interface. It brings a <strong>UI Kit and guidelines</strong> that help mutualize efforts to get back consistency and guiding the change on old and new projects.
			</p>

			
			<h3 class="h3-like" id="profiles">Plurality of Profiles &amp; Teams</h3>
			
			<p>
				Different <strong>designers and developers</strong> within separate production teams that can work on one or more projects during their life and evolution. Each person has its own style and affinities for visual styling, usability or development, what creates disharmony within the project.
			</p>

			<p class="margin-big text-center">

			<p>
				<abbr title="Foyer Design System">FDS</abbr> helps Designers, Developers and Product Owners by bringing libraries to keep consistency.
			</p>



			<h3 class="h3-like" id="impacts">Global Impacts</h3>

			<p>
				Without Design System, all these reasons will stay still and keep creating inconsistencies between interfaces, reducing maintenance and increasing the complexity of future developments.
			</p>

			</p>

			<p>
				Today we are able to tell you that designers and developers are way more efficient in their daily work thanks to library, guidelines bringing structure and rules that help people stay on track.
			</p>


			<h2 id="solution" class="h2-like">Design System as a solution</h2>

			<p>To all of this risks and issues, we chose to build a Design System as a toolbox for designers and developers next to design and code guidelines, in the first time. Foyer Design System will help with consistency through our products and applications.</p>

			<p>The Design System brings a protection to the brand, globally improves the user experience, accelerates and makes our team way more efficiente for building applications. It:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Unifies the digital experience of all our users (clients, agents, etc.),</li>
				<li>Creates a centralized reference for all our applications.</li>
				<li>Facilitates the maintainability of our projects.</li>
				<li>Allows the transversal evolution of the components.</li>
				<li>Encourages transversal communication between projects' stakeholders.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="composition" class="h3-like">Composition</h3>
			TODO
			<ul>
				<li>Design Guide & Graphic Libraries for Designers</li>
				<li>Design Guide for Integrators</li>
				<li>User Guide for Developers</li>
				<li>Native WebComponents web & mobile library</li>
				<li>Examples of generic interfaces & views</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="evolving" class="h3-like">A constantly evolving Design System</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Regular updates of the libraries with new components</li>
				<li>Uniform evolution of design on all projects transparently</li>
				<li>Daily design and code review by the UI / Ux & Integration teams</li>
				<li>A system integrated in the image of the bank, reviewed by the brand managers</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="results" class="h3-like">Expected results:</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Spend more time creating project value (User Experience)</li>
				<li>Spend more time on functional</li>
				<li>Standardizing the experience within Banque de Luxembourg projects</li>
				<li>Increase project performance by optimizing Front resources</li>
				<li>Make the platform easily scalable</li>
    		</ul>

			<p>The Design System wouldn't be a system without rules and guidelines, and it's important to document these. The documentation acts as a source of truth, it fixes our design decisions, helps to keep designers, developers and product owner people on the same level of knowledge. It will also helps us to onboard any new team members or new projects to adopt the design system in the future. The rules of a Design System are not set in stone, they are constantly in work in progress, open to iteration or improvements, adapt and grow. The Design System documents the why, when, where and how.</p>
